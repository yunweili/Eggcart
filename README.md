# Eggcart Information 

Eggcart is a simple fun minigame that involves you the player driving a kart as an egg going around a track and trying to beat the assigned time. We will have checkpoints in which the players are able to get through to add more time to the clock and if they are able to reach all the checkpoints by the time the timer runs out, they win the game. 

There are many features in this game, including: 

Best Time Tracker - Try and beat your best time. 

XP System (Coming Soon) - A system where you are able to gain XP by gaining more and more wins and races. 

Leaderboard System - A system where individuals are able to see the fastest times. The leaderboard is going to be published on our website.
